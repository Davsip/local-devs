LOCAL DEVS connects Local Developers to Cool Projects

Clients can post projects to our platform for review by our Solution Experts. Local Devs can then apply to join a team responsible for developing the full scope of each project.

Once accepted to the project, our Solution Experts will connect the Local Devs and provide an in-depth review of the Clientâ€™s project.

Local Devs will get paid as they complete sections of each project. Manage your own time, take on more projects, earn more money. The opportunities are endless. Our Solution Experts are here to make sure we always have meaningful projects for Local Devs. It will not be just work. It will be fun to work.
